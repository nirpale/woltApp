My assignment for Wolt's Frontend Summer 2020 engineering internship which I coded using React. The end result lists data from local JSON file, which contains information for 50 restaurants, and showcases it using Material UI Card-element. There are also options to sort the data alphabetically or in reversed alphabetical order on top of the page.

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to launch the program.
